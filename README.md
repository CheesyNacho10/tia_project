Repository with the aim of carrying out the practical work for the "TIA" subject of the MUIARFID program at UPV during the 2023/2024 academic year.

## The problem

The problem is based on the optimization of the electrical distribution network, considering the generation and distribution of electrical energy based on real-time demand.

The optimization objectives that can be considered, in addition to minimizing energy losses in the context of the electrical distribution network optimization, include the minimization of operational costs. This objective entails reducing the costs associated with the operation of the electrical network to a minimum. This would include costs such as the fuel used in power plants, infrastructure maintenance costs, transmission and distribution costs, among others. Minimizing operational costs seeks efficient management of available resources for generating and delivering energy. Lastly, we could maximize the use of renewable energies if you want to promote sustainability and reduce the carbon footprint of the electrical network, using sources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. This involves adjusting energy generation to make the most of these clean sources and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

Each of these objectives may be relevant in different contexts and depends on the specific goals and priorities of the utility company, government, or organization that manages the electrical distribution network. The choice of the optimization objective will depend on the particular problems and challenges faced in the electrical network you are studying.

## The solution

To solve this problem, different approaches will be used to model and address it. The first approach will be through genetic algorithms, and the second one will be based on simulated annealing.
